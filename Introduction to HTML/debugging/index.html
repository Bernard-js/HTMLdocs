        <h2>HTML and Debugging</h2>
            <h3>Debugging is not scary</h3>
                <p>
                As you are new to programming, is very common to be scared when an error occurs.
                Those large texts in red may seem like greek for a newbie. 
                You don't have to be scared though, because for that purpose you have Debugging tools,
                that helps you to fix those errors and identify them easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                Therefore, in order to be a good programmer, a deep knowledge of the Debugging tools 
                is as important as dominating the programming language itself.
                </p>
            <h3>Permissive code</h3>
                <p>
                HTML is a more <strong>permissive</strong> language than the traditional programming languages(like Java, C#, etc...).
                That means that errors can be interpret as valid code, but it may not have the output that you expected.
                this is mainly because html is an <em>interpreted</em> language, and not <em>compiled</em> (like the traditional ones).
                </p>
            <h3>HTML Validation</h3>
            <p>
                As each browser has the freedom to interpret a html document the way it's most convenient,
                how can i guarantee that my file is well-formed? 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to validate your HTML file by running it through 
                the Markup Validation Service â€” created and maintained by the W3C(World Wide Web Consortium), 
                the organization that looks after the specifications that define HTML, CSS, and other web technologies.
