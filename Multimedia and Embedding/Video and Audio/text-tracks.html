    <h2>Introduction to WebVTT</h2>
    <!-- this article is still incomplete -->
    <!-- need to discuss the reason for putting video text tracks  -->
    <p>
        some people, for many reasons that will be discussed later, will need
        to read text transcriptions of the audio tracks in some video tracks.
        Thanks to HTML5, it's possible to add <strong>cues</strong> to video files, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subtitles</li>
        <li>Captions</li>
        <li>Timed descriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    to do so, we use a file format called WebVTT, in which the captions will be at.
    then, we use a <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> element, as a child of the video element 
    and after the source element, with a <em>src</em> attribute referencing to the .vtt 
    file. there are other attributes, such as <em>kind</em> and <em>srclang</em> that
    will be discussed later. Here is an example:
    </p>

    <video id="video" controls preload="metadata">
        <source src="assets/videos/sintel-short.webm" type="video/webm">
        <track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="assets/captions/sintel-en.vtt" default>
    </video>
    
    <!-- to be able to see the file, you have to set the property security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false -->
    <!-- remember, this isn't secure! So set to false only to see the subtitle example and then set back again to true -->
