            <h2>Introduction to WebVTT</h2>
            <p>
                some people will need to read text transcriptions of the audio tracks in some video files, for example:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>many people are deaf or have some scale of auditory impairments.</li>
                <li>others might be in a noisy enviroment, like a bar.</li>
                <li>In the same way, people may be in an enviroment where the audio can cause a distraction, like a library.</li>
                <li>People who don't understand the language spoken in the video might want a text transcript or a translation of the audio.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> 
                Thanks to HTML5, it's possible to write text strings along with additional metadata, like specific times that the text should be displayed.
                Those text strings are called <strong>cues
                </strong>, and there are many cues that can be used to video files, such as:
            </p>
            
            <dl>
                <dt>Subtitles</dt>
                <dd>Translation of the audio tracks, used mostly by foreign people.</dd>

                <dt>Captions</dt>
                <dd>Synchronized transcriptions or dialogs, To let people that can't hear the audio understand what's going on.</dd>

                <dt>Timed descriptions</dt>
                <dd>Text that should be spoken by the media player to let blind or visually impaired people understand what's going on.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>to do so, we use a file format called WebVTT, in which the captions will be at. we use a <code>&lt;track&gt;     </code> element, as a child of the video element and after the source tags.</p>

            <p> The track element recieve three attributes: 
            <em>src</em>, that has a path referencing to the .vtt 
            file; <em>kind</em> to specify the kind of cue (subtitles, captions or descriptions) and <em>srclang</em>, that informs to the browser in which language the text tracks are at. Here is an example:
            </p>

            <video id="video" controls preload="metadata" sandbox="allow-same-origin">
                <source src="assets/videos/sintel-short.webm" type="video/webm">
                <track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="assets/captions/sintel-en.vtt" default>
            </video>
            
            <!-- to be able to see the file, you have to set the property security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false in the flags of your web browser -->
            <!-- remember, this isn't secure! So set to false only to see the subtitle example and then set back again to true -->
