                <h2>Video and Audio on the web</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the only 2000's, web developers used to apply video and audio content
                        with a technology called flash. Flash had a lot of problems, it was a
                        proprietary software and it had poor performance on mobile devices as it
                        is well documented in Steve Jobs's article <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Thoughts on Flash</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With the release of HTML5, tools for embed audio and video were created
                        and patching all the problems that Flash had, making it useless. In this 
                        article i'd like to talk about how these tools work.

                    <h3>The Video element</h3>
                    
                        <p>
                            you can embed a video in your website by using the 
                            <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> video element. See an example below: 
                        </p>
            
                        <video src="assets/videos/MetroidPrime.mp4" controls>
                            <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/MetroidPrime_103/MetroidPrime_103_HQ_part03.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p> 
                        </video>
                    
            </section>

            <section>

                <h3>Using multiple formats to improve compatibility</h3>
                
                    <h4>contents of a media file</h4>

                    <h4>media file support in browsers</h4>
                        <p>here is an example of a video that supports many different browsers: </p>

                        <video controls>
                            <source src="assets/videos/MetroidPrime.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                            <source src="assets/videos/MetroidPrime.avi" type="video/avi">
                            <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/MetroidPrime_103/MetroidPrime_103_HQ_part03.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
                        </video>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <!--not completed yet-->
                <h3>Other <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> Features</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><em>width</em> and <em>height</em></dt>
                        <dd> <!-- a description will soon be made --> </dd>

                        <dt>autoplay</dt>
                        <dd> <!-- a description will soon be made --> </dd>

                        <dt>loop</dt>
                        <dd> <!-- a description will soon be made --> </dd>

                        <dt>muted</dt>
                        <dd> <!-- a description will soon be made --> </dd>

                        <dt>poster</dt>
                        <dd> <!-- a description will soon be made --> </dd>

                        <dt>preload</dt>
                        <dd> <!-- a description will soon be made --> </dd>
                    </dl>
                <p>an example of the implementation of these Features would be something like this: </p>

                <video controls
                width="320" height="240"
                loop muted 
                poster="assets/images/nes.jpg"
                >
                    <source src="assets/videos/MetroidPrime.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    <source src="assets/videos/MetroidPrime.avi" type="video/avi">
                    <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/MetroidPrime_103/MetroidPrime_103_HQ_part03.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
                </video>

                <p>Now an example with the autoplay Feature: </p>
                <video controls autoplay muted>
                    <source src="assets/videos/sintel-short.webm" type="video/webm">
                </video>
