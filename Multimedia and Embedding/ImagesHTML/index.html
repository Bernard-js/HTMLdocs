        <h2>Putting images on webpages</h2>
            <p>
            you can add an image to your website by putting an 
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with the <strong>src</strong> attribute,
            which stands for <em>source</em>, it contains the image path. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Here goes an example: </p>
            
            <img src="images/eagle.jpg">
            
            <p>
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is an empty element, meaning that it has neither text nor
            closing tag. So the element will only be usefull if it has at least one attribute.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            it is a good practice to use <strong>relative</strong> paths instead of absolute 
            and put the image files inside an <em>images</em> or <em>assets</em> directory.
            These actions make the <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>'s work a lot easier.
            </p>
            <section>
            <h3>Alternative Text</h3>
                <p>
                the img tag also has an <em>alternative text</em> attribute, <code>alt</code>,
                which is pretty usefull for cases where the image could not be rendered on the page.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                in the next example, we have the same image as before, 
                but their reference at the src attribute is misspelled.
                </p>
                
                <img src="images/egle.jpg" alt="the left side of an eagle's head">
                
                <p>There is many reasons why you'd like to have an alt attribute to your image: </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Screen reader users can listen to the text and have a brief description of the image.</p></li>
                    <li><p>as was shown in the example above, the path name can be misspelled.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The image type isn't supported by the browser.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Search engines can use the text in search queries.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section>
            <h3>Width and Height</h3>
                <p>
                it's also possible to specify the width and height of the image.
                this helps, for example, when the page hasn't yet been loaded, 
                the browser sets a space to fill the image whem it's fully loaded.
                This makes the loading process smoother, improving the user experience. 
                </p>
                
                <img src="images/coffe.jpg" 
                alt="a white cofee cup filled with cofee"
                width="640"
                height="425"
                >

                <p>
                However, you shouldn't change the image's width and height at the attribute. 
                It distorts the image natural form and doesn't produce a good user experience.
                you should use a proper image editor, like adobe photoshop, or CSS instead.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h3>Image Titles</h3>
                <p>
                you can add the <code>title</code> attribute,that gives 
                a brief image description when the mouse is hovered over the image.
                </p>

                <img src="images/coffe.jpg" 
                alt="a white coffe cup filled with coffe"
                width="640"
                height="425"
                title="a cup of coffe in the morning.It can't get better than that"
                >

                <p>
                However, it's not recommended to do it, mainly because of many accessibility problems 
                that have occured with screen readers. you should put that informatio in the article's text instead.

            <h2>Annotating images with figures and captions</h2>

            <p>
            you can put notes and caption to an image by creating a div containing the 
            image and the caption, and then style with CSS and do whatever you want. 
            </p>
            <!-- Something like this: -->
            <!--
                <div>
                    <img src="images/snare.jpg" 
                    alt="a snare with two drumsticks"
                    width="638"
                    height="480"
                    >

                    <p>a basic picture of a snare, with also two drumsticks on it.</p>
                </div>
            -->
            <p>
            That's fine, but it isn't recommended, as it has no semantic value. Instead the HTML5 tags
            <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> fits perfectly at this context.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/snare.jpg" 
                alt="a snare and two drumsticks"
                width="638"
                height="480"
                >

                <figcaption>a basic picture of a snare, with also two drumsticks on it.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>CSS background images</h2>
            <p>
            You can also use CSS to embed images into webpages by using the CSS background-image property 
            For example, to place a background image on every paragraph on a page, you could do this:    
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    p {
                        background-image: url("images/dinosaur.jpg");
                      }
                      
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                dealing with embedded CSS images is a lot easier to position and control then with HTML ones.
                So why use HTML instead? CSS images doesn't have any semantic meaning at all, it has no text equivalent,
                and cannot be read by screen readers, so it's recommended for decoration purposes only.
            </p>

            <p>
            Summing up: if an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you should use an HTML image.
            If an image is purely decoration, you should use CSS background images.
